# information-retrieval-course-project
This project was a teamwork with my teammate [@alireza-dehghan-nayeri](https://github.com/alireza-dehghan-nayeri)
## Description
This GitHub repository is a collection of various exercises in the field of Information Retrieval (IR).

### Files Included:

- **[preprocess.ipynb](https://github.com/fatemehsoufian/information-retrieval-course-project/blob/main/preprocess.ipynb)**: This Jupyter Notebook contains Python code for tokenization. It presents a fundamental step in IR where text data is broken down into individual tokens, enabling further analysis and processing.
  
- **[completePreprocess.ipynb](https://github.com/fatemehsoufian/information-retrieval-course-project/blob/main/completePreprocess.ipynb)**: This notebook provides a complete preprocessing pipeline, including stemming, lemmatizing, and removing stopwords in addition to tokenization. These techniques refine the text data further, improving retrieval quality.
  
- **[invertedIndex.ipynb](https://github.com/fatemehsoufian/information-retrieval-course-project/blob/main/invertedIndex.ipynb)**: This notebook contains Python code that implements an inverted index, a crucial data structure used in IR. The inverted index facilitates efficient document retrieval by mapping terms to the documents in which they appear, enabling fast and accurate information retrieval.
  
- **[booleanModel.ipynb](https://github.com/fatemehsoufian/information-retrieval-course-project/blob/main/booleanModel.ipynb)**: In this notebook, you will find code that implements the Boolean model in IR. The Boolean model allows users to construct complex queries using logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) to retrieve relevant documents based on term presence or absence.
  
- **[tf_idf.ipynb](https://github.com/fatemehsoufian/information-retrieval-course-project/blob/main/tf_idf.ipynb)**: This notebook presents an implementation of the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm. TF-IDF is a widely used weighting scheme that assigns importance to terms based on their frequency within a document and across the corpus.
  
- **[rocchio.ipynb](https://github.com/fatemehsoufian/information-retrieval-course-project/blob/main/rocchio.ipynb)**: Here, you will find code that implements the Rocchio algorithm, a relevance feedback technique used to improve IR systems. The Rocchio algorithm iteratively adjusts query weights based on user feedback to enhance retrieval effectiveness.
  
- **[pageRank.py](https://github.com/fatemehsoufian/information-retrieval-course-project/blob/main/pageRank.py)**: This Python file contains an implementation of the PageRank algorithm. PageRank is a link analysis algorithm commonly used in web search engines to assign importance scores to web pages based on the structure of the hyperlink graph.
  
- **[cosinSimilarity.ipynb](https://github.com/fatemehsoufian/information-retrieval-course-project/blob/main/cosinSimilarity.ipynb)**: This Python file calculates the similarity between two vectors of documents using the cosine similarity metric. Cosine similarity is a widely used measure in IR to determine the similarity between textual entities.
